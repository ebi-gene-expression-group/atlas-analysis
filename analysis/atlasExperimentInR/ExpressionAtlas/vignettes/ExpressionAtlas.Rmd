# Expression Atlas

The [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) [Expression
Atlas](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) consists of hand-picked high quality datasets
from [ArrayExpress](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) that have been manually
curated and re-analyzed via the Expression Atlas analysis pipeline. The
Expression Atlas website allows users to search these datasets for genes and/or
experimental conditions, to discover which genes are expressed in which
tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and hundreds of other experimental
conditions.

The *ExpressionAtlas* R package enables download of pre-packaged data from
Expression Atlas directly into an R session. Raw counts are provided for
RNA-seq datasets, while normalized intensities are available for microarray
experiments. Protocols describing how the data was generated are contained within
the downloaded R objects, with more detailed information available on the
[Expression Atlas website](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa). Sample annotations are
also included in the R object.

# Searching and downloading Expression Atlas data

## Searching

You can search for experiments in Atlas using the `searchAtlasExperiments()`
function. This function returns a *DataFrame* (see
[S4Vectors](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html))
containing the results of your search. The first argument to
`searchAtlasExperiments()` should be a character vector of sample properties,
e.g. biological sample attributes and/or experimental treatments. You may also
optionally provide a species to limit your search to, as a second argument.

```{r}
suppressMessages( library( ExpressionAtlas ) )
atlasRes <- searchAtlasExperiments( "salt", "Oryza sativa" )
atlasRes
```

The *Accession* column contains the ArrayExpress accession of each dataset --
the unique identifier assigned to it. The species, experiment type (e.g.
microarray or RNA-seq), and title of each dataset are also listed.

## Downloading the data

To download the data for any/all of the experiments in your results, you can
use the function `getAtlasData()`. This function accepts a vector of
ArrayExpress accessions. The data is downloaded into a *SimpleList* object (see package
[S4Vectors](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html)), with one
entry per experiment, listed by accession.

For example, to download all the datasets in your results:

```{r}
allExps <- getAtlasData( atlasRes$Accession )
allExps
```

To only download the RNA-seq experiment(s):

```{r}
rnaseqExps <- getAtlasData( 
    atlasRes$Accession[ 
        grep( 
            "rna-seq", 
            atlasRes$Type, 
            ignore.case = TRUE 
        ) 
    ] 
)
rnaseqExps
```

To access an experiment summary, use the accession:

```{r}
mtab1624 <- allExps[[ "E-MTAB-1624" ]]
mtab1625 <- allExps[[ "E-MTAB-1625" ]]
```

Each dataset is also represented by a *SimpleList*, with one entry per platform
used in the experiment. For RNA-seq data there will only ever be one entry,
named `rnaseq`. For microarray data, there is one entry per array design used,
listed by ArrayExpress array design accession (see below).

### RNA-seq experiment summaries

Following on from above, `mtab1625` now contains a *SimpleList* object 
with a single entry named `rnaseq`. For RNA-seq experiments, this entry is a
*RangedSummarizedExperiment* object (see package
[SummarizedExperiment](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)).

```{r}
sumexp <- mtab1625$rnaseq
sumexp
```

The matrix of raw counts for this experiment is stored in the *assays* slot:

```{r}
head( assays( sumexp )$counts )
```

The sample annotations can be found in the *colData* slot:

```{r}
colData( sumexp )
```

Information describing how the raw data files were processed to obtain the raw
counts matrix are found in the *metadata* slot:

```{r}
metadata( sumexp )
```

### Single-channel microarray experiments

Data from a single-channel microarray experiment, e.g.
[E-MTAB-1624](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-1624), is
represented as one or more
*[ExpressionSet](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Biobase/inst/doc/ExpressionSetIntroduction.pdf)*
object(s) in the SimpleList that is downloaded. *ExpressionSet* objects are
indexed by the ArrayExpress accession(s) of the microarray design(s) used in the
original experiment.

```{r}
names( mtab1624 )
affy126data <- mtab1624[[ "A-AFFY-126" ]]
affy126data
```

The matrix of normalized intensity values is in the *assayData* slot:

```{r}
head( exprs( affy126data ) )
```

The sample annotations are in the *phenoData* slot:

```{r}
pData( affy126data )
```

A brief outline of how the raw data was normalized is in the *experimentData* slot:

```{r}
preproc( experimentData( affy126data ) )
```

# Downloading a single Expression Atlas experiment summary

You can also download data for a single Expression Atlas experiment using the
`getAtlasExperiment()` function:

```{r}
mtab3007 <- getAtlasExperiment( "E-MTAB-3007" )
```
